# Hydrawise API models

This package contains models that aid in deserializing responses from the [Hydrawise API](https://support.hydrawise.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008965753-Hydrawise-API-Information). They're built primarily to support [Irri](https://github.com/btrautmann/hydrawise-companion), a companion app to the first-party supported Hydrawise app. Therefore, they are not necessarily complete in that not all fields are represented for each model, but I'm very open to contributions to add missing fields, and I may add them myself later.
